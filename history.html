        <h2 class="text-center slim">History of Olumo Rock.</h2>

            <p>Olumo Rock is an ancient rock located in a popular city 
            called 'Abeokuta' which means 'a city under the Rock'. The
            city is situated in the south west region of Nigeria and 
            served as a fortress to the Egba residents during the inter-tribal
            war around 1800. The rock was discovered by a hunter named
            'Adagba' in the 19th Century and was beneficial in helping
            the Egba’s win the inter-tribal war.</p>

            <p>The name 'Olumo' is derived from 2 words in Yoruba language
            'Olu' which means 'God' and 'Mo' which means 'Moulded' 
             and put together means 'God benevolently moulded this rock'. 
             It served as a strategic hideout, a fortress and a vantage 
             point for Egba Warriors to monitor the enemy’s advance, leading 
             to eventual triumph in war. It housed them for 3 years while 
             the war lasted so Olumo Rock is not just a 
             tourist attraction but a symbol of freedom, victory, 
             strength and peace for the Egba people.</p>

            <p>It is a massive outcrop of granite rock which towers above
            the city makes it nature's gift to mankind. The complete climb 
            without any shortcuts will take about 1 hour 30 minutes and 
            there are man-made stairs carved into the rock for a part of
            the climb and afterwards you must climb with rocks as
            footholds along with some ladders that have been provided as an
            aid to visitors. There is an option of an automated lift provided for 
            small kids and those who are afraid of heights and cannot climb 
            the rock by themselves so they don't miss out on the adventure of 
            experiencing what it feels like to reach the peak of the rock.</p>

            <p>It is home to many tourists, mountain climbers and fun-lovers 
            around the world therefore, a beehive of activites takes place 
            there throughout the year. There are tour guides to take you
            on the journey to the top of the rock while explaining the 
            history of the rock.  On the way, you will find footprints of
            the early dwellers along with remnants of some of their 
            belongings.</p>
 
            <p>The centre boasts of a contemporary art gallery 
            filled with paintings and sculptures, an heritage museum,
            the popular african tie and dye cloth market, restaurants, 
            restrooms and free parking area.</p>
