This is a history website for Ogun State Ministry of Tourism, Nigeria. It was developed to provide information to tourists and potential investors and also for the purpose of preserving our culture and heritage for the next generation.

Its aim is to open up the state and make it a tourism hub within Africa and the world at large.

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices thereby making it easy to navigate through and find useful and relevant content.

    * Design

        * Colour Scheme

            * The two main colours used are light sky blue and black i.e the background colour is light sky blue with black fonts.

        *  Typography

            * The (---------------) font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font in case the imported font was not imported correctly. (-------------) is a clean font used frequently in programming so it is both appropriate and attractive.

        * Imagery

            * Imagery is important. The large image of the Olumo Rock is used  to capture the users imagination and attract them to visit the tourist centre.  It is designed to take up the full width of the 'Home' Page to make it striking and catch the user's attention.
