# Olumo Rock  

This is a history website created for christYmet, a subsidiary department under the Ogun State Ministry of Tourism in Nigeria. It was developed to provide useful information to both first time and returning visitors ranging from tourists, students, researchers of history and potential investors alike about the famous Olumo Rock located in Abeokuta, the South Western part of Nigeria in West Africa. 

The aim of the product owner which is christYmet, is to assist the government in its effort to open up the state for tourism and attract visitors to the Olumo Rock in order to make it a tourist hub within Africa and the world at large thereby providing jobs for the locals which results into economy boost and icrease in revenue generation for the state.  It also aims at preserving the cultural heritage of the Yoruba tribe in South West Nigeria for both the present and future generations.

            * The (---------------) font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font in case the imported font was not imported correctly. (-------------) is a clean font used frequently in programming so it is both appropriate and attractive.

Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

* First Time Visitor Goals

    i. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the history that surrounds the existence of the rock.

        a. Users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to take them to any page of their choice.

        b. Users are presented with a large image of the Olumo Rock which covers the entire width of the page and its aim is to make the user's imagination run wild and attract them to come visit.

        c. Users are given a short introduction of the site and an in-depth history of the rock.

        d. The 'Gallery' page displays various images of the rock taken at different views and their historical importance. It also contains pictures of tourists/visitors to the centre.

        e. Information about the opening times and entry fee are displayed clearly on the home page for every visitor and most especially first time visitors to see.

    ii. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily throughout the site to find content.

        a. The site was built with flexibility in mind.  This means that width percentages that allows the site to scale up and down easily across different screen sizes and devices were used.

        b. The site was made never to entrap the user.  There is a clean navigation bar at the top of each page and each of the links clearly describes what page the users will end up at when it is clicked.

        c. There is a "Back to top of the Page" button at the bottom of each page so users can easily get back to the top of the page when at the bottom instead of using the scroll bar which can be frustrating to the user.

        d. There is a Google Map link in the "Contact Page" that gives direction to users on how to locate the centre for first time visitors.

    iii. As a First Time Visitor, I want to lok for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    a. The user can scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

    b. On the "Contact Us" page, additional ways of getting in touch are provided there.
