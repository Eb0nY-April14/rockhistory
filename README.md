# Olumo Rock 

This website was created for the purpose of providing useful information about the Olumo Rock Tourist Centre to both first time and returning visitors ranging from tourists, students, researchers of history and potential investors alike about the famous Olumo Rock located in Abeokuta, the South Western part of Nigeria in West Africa. 

It is an history website created for christYmet, a subsidiary department under the Ogun State Tourism Board in Nigeria.

The aim of the product owner which is christYmet, is to assist the government in its effort to open up the state for tourism and attract visitors to the Olumo Rock in order to make it a tourist hub within Africa and the world at large thereby providing jobs for the locals which results into economy boost and icrease in revenue generation for the state.  It also aims at preserving the cultural heritage of the Yoruba tribe in South West Nigeria for both the present and future generations.
